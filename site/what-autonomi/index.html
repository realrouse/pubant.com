    </h1>
    <p>
      A decentralized, censorship-proof network that gives control back to the users — not corporations or governments.

    <h2>What Makes Autonomi Different?</h2>
    <p>
      The Autonomi Network is a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer internet where websites, apps, and data are stored across a global network of users instead of centralized servers.
      There’s no single point of failure, and no central authority that can control or remove content.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Truly Decentralized:</strong> No servers. No gatekeepers. Content is distributed across thousands of nodes worldwide.</li>
      <li><strong>Permanent Storage:</strong> Once uploaded, your site lives forever. It can't be taken down by anyone.</li>
      <li><strong>Anonymous and Secure:</strong> Your identity is protected, and your data is safe from surveillance or censorship.</li>
      <li><strong>Community Powered:</strong> Owned and run by its users, not by corporations or centralized companies.</li>
      <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Autonomi is built with transparency and open collaboration at its heart.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      In today’s web, large companies and governments control most of the data. They can track you, block access, and even erase your content.
      Autonomi changes that forever — giving you true freedom to create, share, and access information without restrictions.
    </p>

    <h2>How Autonomi Works</h2>
    <p>
      By using decentralized technologies, Autonomi splits and distributes files across the network. No one owns your data but you.
      When you publish a site, it becomes part of the network’s shared storage — accessible by anyone, anytime.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don’t need a traditional web hosting company. You don't even need permission. Once your content is on the network, it's available globally, permanently.
